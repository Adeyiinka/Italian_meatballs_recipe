        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Tender Italian meatballs are described as
          <em>soft, light, juicy, and flavorful</em>, often having a
          <strong>"melt-in-your-mouth"</strong> or
          <strong>"pillowy soft"</strong> texture. They are typically made with
          a blend of <mark>meats</mark> and other ingredients that enhance
          moisture and prevent them from becoming dense.

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Soak the bread: In a small bowl, tear the bread into small pieces
              and cover with milk. Let it soak for about 5-10 minutes until
              completely moist, then mash with a fork to form a coarse paste (a
              panade).
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine ingredients: In a large bowl, add the ground beef and
              pork. Add the mashed bread mixture, beaten eggs, Parmesan cheese,
              parsley, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to gently
              mix all the ingredients until just combined. Do not overmix, as
              this can make the meatballs tough.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shape the meatballs: With wet or lightly oiled hands, roll the
              mixture into 1.5 to 2-inch (golf ball size) rounds. This recipe
              typically yields about 20-24 meatballs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Brown the meatballs: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over
              medium-high heat. Add the meatballs in a single layer, in batches
              if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry, turning
              occasionally, until nicely browned on all sides (about 5-10
              minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
              Simmer in sauce: While the meatballs are browning, heat your
              tomato sauce in a separate large pot or a large, deep pan. Once
              all the meatballs are browned, gently transfer them into the
              simmering sauce. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let
              them simmer gently for at least 30 minutes, or longer for a richer
              flavor, until cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve: Serve the meatballs hot with your favorite pasta or crusty
              Italian bread, garnished with extra fresh basil and grated
              Parmesan cheese.
            </li>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          The key to tender, flavorful Italian meatballs lies in using a bread
          and milk mixture (panade) to lock in moisture and carefully avoiding
          overmixing the meat. Browning them first, then simmering them gently
          in a rich tomato sauce, ensures the best results. This is a
